## Description
What you should learn from this project is the following:

* What is recursion
* How to implement recursion
* In what situations you should implement recursion
* In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion


---

### [0-puts recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c)
* Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

### [1-print rev recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c)
* Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

### [2-strlen recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c)
* Write a function that returns the length of a string.

### [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c)
* Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

### [4-pow recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c)
* Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

### [5-sqrt recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c)
* Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

### [6-is prime number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c)
* Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
